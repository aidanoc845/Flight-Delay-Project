# Analyzing Global Air Travel Patterns and Delays Using Flight Data
Project Description: 
This project analyzes air travel delay patterns using the U.S. Department of Transportation On-Time Performance dataset.
It identifies the most delay-prone carriers and airports, examines seasonal trends, and uses an interactive model to determine delay likelihood for specified parameters.
The provided Python scripts support data processing, summarization, and the interactive model for this analysis.
